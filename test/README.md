## Cell Free Metabolic Model ##

### Background ###
This repository contains [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) cell free metabolic model (CFMM) code generated by the [JuKCF-Generator](https://github.com/varnerlab/JuKCF-Generator) system.
The JuKCF-Generator framework generates a dynamic model of cell free metabolism using the hybrid modeling framework of Wayman et al:

[Wayman J, Sagar A and J. Varner (2015) Dynamic Modeling of Cell Free Biochemical Networks using Effective Kinetic Models. Processes DOI:10.3390/pr3010138](http://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/3/1/138)

### Generated model files ###
The model files generated by JuKCF:

* ``Balances.m`` encodes the material balances for your CFMM
* ``Control.m`` encodes allosteric control mechanisms which regulates enzyme activity
* ``DataDictionary.m`` encodes the CFMM model parameters.
* ``Dilution.m`` encodes reactor feed related terms (form depends upon ``-r`` option used during generation)
* ``Driver.m`` encodes sample code to solve the CFMM model equations
*  ``Inputs.m`` encodes dynamic inputs to the CFMM not contained in the reactor feed code
*  ``Kinetics.m`` encodes the reaction kinetics for the CFMM
*  ``Network.dat`` encodes the stoichiometric matrix for the CFMM
*  ``SolveBalances.m`` encoded the logic to solve the CFMM balance equations (calls the ODE solver)

### How do I solve the model equations?
The model equations can be solved using the ``Driver.m`` script, or by calling the ``SolveBalances`` function encoded in ``SolveBalances.m``:

	[T,X] = SolveBalances(time_start,time_stop,time_step_size,data_dictionary)

where:

Argument | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
``time_start`` | scalar (float/double) | Initial simulation time (default time unit is min)
``time_stop`` | scalar (float/double) | Final simulation time (default time unit is min)
``time_step`` | scalar (float/double) | Simulation time step (depending upon the solver, the internal time step used during the solution of the CFMM equations may be different)
``data_dictionary`` | Octave [structure](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/doc/v4.0.0/Structures.html) | Instance of the data dictionary structure created by the ``DataDictionary`` function
``T`` | array (``number_of_steps x 1``) | Output time array (``time_state:time_step:time_stop``)
``X`` | array (``number_of_steps x number_of_states``) | Output state array (solution of the model equations)

### What is required to solve the model equations?
[Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) must be installed to solve the model equations. In addition, if the CFMM was generated using the ``-r F`` (fed batch) or ``-r C`` (continuos) reactor options, the reactor feed profile and feed composition must be specified in ``DataDictionary``.
